Adjust temperature
Adjust Cooling Rate
Think of temperature and cooling rate as their own matrix - find best balance for size of graph
We might be able to create two new functions that work out the coolrate and the temperature
Compare against TSP LIb
Better to compare variables in sim annealing than to have multiple metas
Compare starting at all nodes
